# Rainfall Prediction Project üå¶Ô∏è

This project is an interactive rainfall prediction application built with Python and Streamlit. It uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of rain based on various weather parameters.

## Features

*   **Interactive Interface:** Input key weather parameters such as pressure, humidity, cloud cover, and wind speed.
*   **Real-Time Predictions:** Receive instant results on the likelihood of rainfall.
*   **Machine Learning Model:** A trained model ensures accurate and reliable predictions.
*   **User-Friendly Design:** Built with Streamlit for a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Dataset

The model was trained using a weather dataset containing the following features:

| Feature       | Description                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| pressure      | Atmospheric pressure in hPa                              |
| dewpoint      | Dew point temperature in ¬∞C                             |
| humidity      | Relative humidity in percentage                         |
| cloud         | Cloud cover in percentage                               |
| rainfall      | Indicator of rainfall (1 for rain, 0 for no rain)         |
| sunshine      | Sunshine duration in hours                                |
| winddirection | Wind direction in degrees                                 |
| windspeed     | Wind speed in km/h                                        |

The dataset contains 366 rows and 8 columns, offering diverse weather scenarios for robust model training.

## Model Creation Workflow

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Loading, handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding the target variable.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing feature distributions and examining correlations.
3.  **Feature Selection:** Selecting relevant features based on their importance.
4.  **Model Training:** Training various models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and evaluating their performance.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Analyzing predictions, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and achieving a final model accuracy of **[Insert your accuracy here, e.g., 90%]**.
6.  **Model Deployment:** Saving the trained model for deployment.
